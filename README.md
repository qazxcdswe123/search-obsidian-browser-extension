## What is this?
A simple plugin that allows you to search Obsidian in Google.
You need to install both this browser extension and a plugin in Obsidian to take effects.

## How to use
1. Install [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-obsidian-in-google/dkefnggaipjamcbnjdlapgilhlaikbme) in Chrome.
2. Install [Obsidian Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin in Obsidian, configure the plugin as you like.
3. Install [Search Obsidian in Google](https://github.com/qazxcdswe123/search-obsidian-in-google) plugin in Obsidian. You can install it from obsidian plugin store.
4. Configure the plugin in Obsidian, set the port number, authentication token, and the vault name in the Chrome extension.
